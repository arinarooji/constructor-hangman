### Guide
_________
#### Setup
- Clone the respository, or download the ZIP file.
- Change directory to the root of **hangman-CLI**. Example:  *~/example/hangman-CLI*  **(this is the root)**.
- In the command line, type **npm install** to install the **inquirer** dependency.
- Now you're ready to game! While in the root, type **node hangman** to start playing hangman.
#### How to Play
- As soon as you run the file, you will be asked to guess a letter.
- Take a wild guess! After you hit the enter key, the incomplete word will appear along with your remaining guesses.
- If you correctly guess a letter, that guess is not subtracted from your remaining guesses.
- If you run out of guesses, don't get hung up on it! A new word will be selected for you to guess.
